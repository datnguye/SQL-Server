Basic view of Database Snapshots (SQL Server)
Available from SQL 2016 SP1 or later
Docs: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/databases/database-snapshots-sql-server

Where should to use:
+ Locally develop a feature: Easily revert database state from a snapshot
+ Testing environment: Useful when repeatedly running each round of testing. Restore from a snapshot that is much quick than restoring from a backup)
+ Reporting purposes: Snapshot working as a copy of source database but read-only

Limitations as some:
+ Double up database size so disk space issue may occur
+ Snapshot must be remaining on the same server instance as the source database
+ Snapshot is dependent on source database. If source database is not available, all its snapshot will be not available too
+ Database cannot be dropped if any snapshots existing

Usage:
+ Generate new database snapshot:
USE your_db
GO
EXEC MaintenanceDBSnapshot @LiveRun = 1

+ Restore snapshot to revert the source database to the time of snapshot creation:
USE master
GO
EXEC MaintenanceDBRestoreFromSnapshot @DbName = 'your_db', @FromSnapshot = 'your_db-SNAPSHOT-date-time', @LiveRun = 1
